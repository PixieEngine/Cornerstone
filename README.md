=======

Cornerstone is a JavaScript extension library that gives you the core classes you've always wanted. Fully tested and fully documented, Cornerstone runs in any JavaScript environment, from the browser to the server, or even on Xbox Live.

Array Extensions
----------------

Ruby's core library inspired the Cornerstone `Array` extensions. Staple methods include `each`, `remove`, `select`, and `include`. Fancier methods such as `partition`, `rand`, and `extremes` come in handy during game programming or web application development.

Number Extensions
-----------------

JavaScript's `Number` class provides many useful methods, but sometimes leaves us hanging. Cornerstone extends `Number.prototype` with `clamp`, `times`, and `abs`. It also provides the classic utilities `floor`, `ceil`, and `round`. For a little spice, try `primeFactors`, `toColorPart`, or a host of other great methods for approaching and modifying numbers, and see where your imagination takes you.

String Extensions
-----------------

Default JavaScript does a lot with `String`, but Cornerstone goes even further. Inspired by the Rails inflector, there are many methods to alter strings, such as `titleize`, `underscore`, and `humanize`. Methods like `parse` and `constantize` are especially powerful for metaprogramming.
