Cornerstone.coffee
=======

Cornerstone.coffee is a JavaScript extension library that gives you the core classes that you've always wanted. Cornerstone is fully tested and fully documented and runs in any JavaScript environment, from the browser to the server, even on Xbox Live.

Array Extensions
----------------

The array extensions are inspired by Ruby's core library. Simple things like `each`, `remove`, `select`, and `include` are the staples. Fancier methods such as `partition`, `rand`, and `extremes` often come in handy during game programming.

Number Extensions
-----------------

JavaScript is a language that allows for `Number` to provide many useful methods, but leaves us hanging. Cornerstone extends Number.prototype with the ever-popular `clamp`, `times`, and `abs`. It also provides the classic utilities `floor`, `ceil`, and `round`. But that's just the beginning, there are many more including `primeFactors`.

String Extensions
-----------------

String is one of the classes that default JavaScript does the most with, but why stop there. Inspired by the Rails inflector, there are many methods provided to alter strings such as `titleize`, `underscore`, and `humanize`. Some especially powerful methods like `parse` and `constantize` will no doubt come in handy.
